Final capstone for the **Imperial College Business School Professional
Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**.

Over 13 rounds, this project optimises **eight unknown black-box
functions** of increasing dimensionality (2D to 8D) under a strict query
budget — one new query per function per round. The internal equations
are hidden; only inputs and outputs are observable. The task is to find
the input that **maximises** each function through disciplined,
evidence-driven, iterative decisions.

The exercise mirrors how optimisation actually works in research and
industry — hyperparameter tuning, experimental design, process
optimisation, drug discovery — where evaluations are expensive, data is
scarce, and the system is a black box.

## The approach in brief

Each round, for every function, a uniform pipeline runs:

1. **Fit two surrogates** — a tuned Gaussian Process (primary) and an
   SVR (independent cross-check).
2. **Diagnose locally** — a per-dimension "nudge" test maps the gradient
   around the current best, independent of the acquisition function.
3. **Propose candidates** — the expected-improvement point, the
   strongest nudge directions, and a manual hypothesis-driven point.
4. **Filter with the "untrust rule"** — never chase an acquisition
   candidate the model itself does not rate above the current best.
5. **Decide** — submit the best-supported candidate, overriding the
   model when the diagnostic gives clearer evidence, and log the full
   rationale.

In the final weeks, **K-means clustering** was added as a diagnostic to
characterise each function's search space — separating high-value
regions from exploration scatter, confirming multimodality, and
exposing dimensions that had never been varied inside the best region.

## Functions

| Function | Dim | Scenario | Objective |
|----------|-----|----------|-----------|
| F1 | 2D | Radiation Detection | Locate a contamination source in a 2D field |
| F2 | 2D | Noisy Model | Maximise a noisy log-likelihood |
| F3 | 3D | Drug Discovery | Minimise side effects (negated for maximisation) |
| F4 | 4D | Warehouse Placement | Optimise product placement |
| F5 | 4D | Chemical Yield | Maximise yield of a unimodal process |
| F6 | 5D | Cake Recipe | Maximise a recipe score (negative by design, pushed toward zero) |
| F7 | 6D | Hyperparameter Tuning | Maximise model accuracy / F1 |
| F8 | 8D | 8D Optimisation | Maximise validation accuracy across eight hyperparameters |

**Inputs**: numerical vectors with every value in [0, 1], submitted as a
hyphen-separated string to six decimals (e.g. `0.241041-0.805036-0.905090`).
**Outputs**: a single scalar — higher is better.
**Seed data**: 10 to 40 observations per function (varying by function), growing by one per round.

## Results

Best output found per function over the campaign:

| Function | Dim | Best output | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------------|-------|
| F1 | 2D | **9.24e-5** | Narrow ridge navigated by small disciplined steps; a per-dimension override found the active axis after a long gradient exhausted, and the final round added a further **+37%** |
| F2 | 2D | **0.7184** | An exploration probe beat local refinement; function confirmed **bimodal** |
| F3 | 3D | **-0.0302** | Converged early to a narrow single peak |
| F4 | 4D | **0.7420** | Tight bracketed peak; clustering revealed untouched dimensions inside the best region |
| F5 | 4D | **8662.48** | Boundary push gave the biggest single-round gain (**+85%**); a strongly nonlinear ridge, invisible to the surrogate, surfaced via clustering |
| F6 | 5D | **-0.1609** | The most volatile function (GP error ~67%); minimal steps and distrusting the model finally beat a long-standing best in the last round |
| F7 | 6D | **2.9906** | Two bold, well-calibrated multi-dimensional moves the surrogate under-predicted — the final round added **+39%** on top of an earlier +19% |
| F8 | 8D | **9.9345** | Converged; model confidence kept rising while real gains decayed to noise |

Numbers reflect the final results across all 13 rounds; see the
[Model Card](BBO_Modelcard.md) for the full performance discussion.

## What this project demonstrates

This capstone is a compact demonstration of skills that transfer
directly to data science, ML engineering, and quantitative
decision-making roles:

- **Decision-making under uncertainty** — every round committed to one
  action on incomplete information, with an explicit, logged rationale.
- **Working with scarce, expensive data** — the entire campaign ran on
  tens of data points per function, exactly the regime where careful
  modelling matters most (clinical, experimental, and process data
  rarely arrive in abundance).
- **Surrogate modelling and calibration** — fitting Gaussian Processes
  and SVRs, reading their calibration honestly, and knowing when *not*
  to trust a confident model.
- **Diagnostic rigour** — building independent checks (per-dimension
  nudge tests, dual surrogates, clustering) rather than trusting a
  single black-box recommendation.
- **Communication and documentation** — a datasheet, a model card, and
  round-by-round reflections that make every decision auditable and
  reproducible.

These are the same competencies behind model tuning, experimental
design, A/B testing, and any setting where a system must be improved
without full knowledge of how it works — including data-driven
innovation in health and MedTech.

## How to run

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/GPAjay/Imperial_Executive_Education_Capstone2026.git
cd Imperial_Executive_Education_Capstone2026

# Environment
pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter

# Open any function's pipeline or K-means notebook
